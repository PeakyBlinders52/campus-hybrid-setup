# Setting Up Your Computer For App Academy

When preparing for App Academy, it is vitally important that your computer be
set up in a very specific way. Not taking the time to do this correctly the
first time will likely result in repeated issues and distractions, preventing
you from concentrating on the curriculum.

In the left-hand sidebar menu, navigate to the guide for your particular
operating system: macOS with an M1 chip, macOs without an M1 chip, Ubuntu, or
Windows. (The macOs readings will tell you how to determine whether or not you
have an M1 chip; if your Mac is newer than late 2020, you likely have an M1.)
From there you can proceed to the directions for installing the individual
components of your development environment.
