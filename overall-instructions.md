# Setting Up Your Computer For App Academy

When preparing for App Academy, it is vitally important that your computer be
set up in a very specific way. Not taking the time to do this correctly the
first time will likely result in repeated issues and distractions, preventing
you from concentrating on the curriculum.

To find the instructions for installing the components that you will need,
navigate to the guide for your particular operating system in the left-hand
sidebar menu:

* macOS with an M1 chip
* macOs without an M1 chip
* Ubuntu
* Windows

(The macOs guides will tell you how to determine whether or not you have an M1
chip; if your Mac is newer than late 2020, you likely have an M1.)
